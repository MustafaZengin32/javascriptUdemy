# Task: Start creating a small library

Create a JavaScript array called books that stores information about each book, including the title, author, availability (whether it's sold out or in stock), and price. Follow the steps below:

## Array Setup

Create an array called books containing objects.
Each object should represent a book with the following properties:

- title (string)
- author (string)
- inStock (boolean - true if in stock, false if sold out)
- price (number)

## Add Books

Initialize the array with 3 books.

## Display Books in HTML

Sort the array alphabetically by book title.
Display the list of books dynamically in the HTML, showing their title, author, availability (in stock or sold out), and price.

## Allow User Input

Add a form or input fields in the HTML to allow the user to add new books to the array. When a new book is added, update the displayed list.
Style with CSS Flexbox:

Use CSS Flexbox to style the displayed book list and input form. Ensure the layout is responsive and visually appealing.
