# Task: Convert Weekday Numbers to Names

Write a function called _weekNumbersToWords_ that takes an input array of numbers (from 1 to 7), and returns an array where each number is converted to the corresponding weekday name.

You must use a **switch** statement, not if/else, to perform the conversions.

### Example

**Input:** [1,4,6,3,2]<br>
**Output:** ["Monday", "Thursday", "Saturday", "Wednesday", "Tuesday"]
